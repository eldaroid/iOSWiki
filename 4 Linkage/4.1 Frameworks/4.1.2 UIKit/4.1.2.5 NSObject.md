## UIKit

The UIKit framework provides the classes needed to construct and manage an applicationâ€™s user interface for iOS. It provides an application object, event handling, drawing model, windows, views, and controls specifically designed for a touch screen interface. The UIKit framework defines a number of functions, many of them used in graphics and drawing operations.
