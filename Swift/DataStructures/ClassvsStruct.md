## Class vs Struct

The difference in Class and Structure
Summarize the difference between Class and Structure

| Comparision | Class | Structure  |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Type** | Classes are reference types| Structures are value types |
| **Inheritance** | Classes have an inheritance that allows one class to inherit the characteristics of another | Structures do not support inheritance |
| **Storage** | Class instances are stored on the heap | Structure properties are stored on the stack  |
| **Initializer** | We have to define the initializer manually | Struct gets a default initializer automatically |
| **Thread−safe** | Classes are not fully thread−safe | The structure is thread−safe or singleton at all times  |
